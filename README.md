Power BI	Interactive dashboard creation and reporting
🗃️ Dataset Description:

The dataset consists of historical Domino's Pizza sales records _

🧪 Key Steps & Methodology :

1. Data Collection & Cleaning

Imported CSV data into Excel and performed initial cleaning (missing values, duplicates, formatting).

Loaded cleaned data into Python using Pandas.

Performed further cleaning: type conversions, null handling, outlier removal using IQR and Z-score.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Analyzed sales trends by date, day of the week, and time of day.

Identified top-performing pizza items and categories.

Investigated customer behavior: order frequency, peak times, preferred payment methods.

Visualized with Seaborn: heatmaps, bar plots, line graphs.

3. Business Insights

Most profitable days and hours of operation.

Seasonal or monthly sales fluctuations.

Sales performance by location.

Correlation between delivery time and customer ratings (if available).

4. Power BI Dashboard

Created an interactive dashboard with:

Sales by Category, Store, and Time
